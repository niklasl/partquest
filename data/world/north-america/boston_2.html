You peer through the window at Dino’s, trying to look casual. Inside, Dino piles a bunch of ingredients onto a table: a healthy pile of tomatoes, jars of sugar and salt, a bowl of chilies, onions, and a magnificent jewel of an aubergine. Hmm... But where do all these things come from? You wrack your brain for what little you know.
  </p>
  <p>
Tomatoes: A popular staple of Italian-American cooking. 
  </p>
  <p>
Salt: traditionally harvest
  </p>
  <p>
Sugar: Cane sugar is a warm-climate crop. Could the cane sugar from the caponata come from the southern US? 
  </p>

You stare, perplexed, at the map Al gave you. You might as well look somewhere. Where to start?
  </p>
  <p>
You pause at the gate, trying to decide where to go
  </p>
  <p>
The busboy is in the back shovelling pasta into his face from the plate balanced on his knees. As you approach, he is startled. 
  </p>
  <p>
“Who’s there?!”
  </p>
  <p>
You emerge from the shadows.
  </p>
  <p>
He looks relieved. “I thought you were Dino! I can’t have him catch me eating his special bolonongaise. He’s crazy about it! He says the secret is in the chilies. The best places to grow them are where it’s really hot, down south from here. He knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy that grows them in...” He suddenly looks horrified. “I don’t think Dino would want me to tell you this!”
  </p>
  <p>
You shrug. “Well, thanks, kid.” You have a feeling he may have just told you more than he thinks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let’s start searching for the ingredients:
